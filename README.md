A web dashboard for NGO

#### Abstract Idea
It was a portal for the people who were willing to donate money, food, blood, clothes,etc for a noble cause. 
The stakeholders were the members, the volunteers and the donors. 
The portal helps to digitalize the information regarding members' details, info about the events to be/already conducted by the organization, donations per year,etc. 
We've also kept a forum for the volunteers and members if there might be any queries/discussions to be held. 
We've also used OCR technology for handwriting recognition to store the existing handwritten records as digital data.
